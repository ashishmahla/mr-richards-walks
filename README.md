# mr-richards-walks

Developed as a solution to the following task:

**STATEMENT**

Design and build an Android app for a Mr. Richard Ram(57 years old)  who wants it to quickly guide him in navigation for his occasional walks.

The app should accept 2  or more addresses, once enough locations are acquired from the user, it should draw a walking route between those points on the map, route color should change: for less than 4km black, less than 20km to be blue, any distance above 20km will be purple. When clicked on the route, a popup should display a list of all the way-points(suggested: use data-binding).
